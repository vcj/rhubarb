The Petworth Farmers Market started May 1st and, one of the stands, bless ‘em, day one, carried rhubarb. Your pal VCJD is a real rhubarb head and bought a few pounds from them every Saturday morning. What a nice way to start the weekend: with a sack of fresh rhubarb, ready to go in whatever. That was written in the past tense because tomorrow….is the last day of rhubarb. Not forever - it’ll be at other markets, and sometimes the safeway has a few limp stalks, but my personal season is over. Also I think too much rhubarb might be bad for my teeth.

Here are all of the things I made, in order from best to worst.

First, a few notes (always a few notes): I’m not great at the careful details/hand-eye coordination required for really attractive food. I’m even worse at taking photos so only some of these have pictures. Leave me alone!!! Also, there’s no strawberry rhubarb pie here. In the US at least, that tends to be how you see rhubarb prepared. Nothing really against it, I just prefer other methods.

A few of these involve rhubarb syrup. You can make rhubarb syrup by making rhubarb compote (aka rhubarb slop) and straining it. Both parts, slop and syrup, are wonderful additives for basically anything you want to rhubarbify. I’ve had a lot of rhubarb tom collinses this spring. A few of these also involve poached rhubarb. Poaching rhubarb requires an attention span I simply do not possess, I tried many times to poach rhubarb and keep the stalks intact but almost always I did it a little too long or too warm and it disintegrated into strings. No harm done, of course, it’s usually just for visual appeal. If you want that, roasting is less finicky and will keep the shape more or less intact.

1. Rhubarb eclairs with pandan glaze and candied rhubarb.
Eclairs: I didn’t need to make dozens of eclairs, I just wanted a few, so this recipe was perfect in terms of amount. It also just made wonderful eclairs. 
Rhubarb creme patisserie: this was left over from the gateau basque. It wasn’t as rhubarb as I would have liked, but it was fine. 
Pandan glaze:  Just a regular confectioner’s sugar glaze with a bit of pandan. You can probably find pandan extract at your local pan-Asian market. If you haven’t had it before, the flavor is sort of like a warm vanilla coconut? It’s hard to describe, it’s delightful and will dye everything it touches neon green so be careful.
Candied rhubarb: I tried to make the curls. Didn’t really work out for me. Oh well. Still nice.

2. Khoresh-e Rivas (Persian rhubarb stew).
Rhubarb is not just for sweet dishes!!! Pal Nozlee recommended this. Nozlee is never wrong.

3. Rhubarb crumb cake with sumac crumb
Snacking Cakes has been The Book of The Pandemic for my friendship slack; as fan of both rhubarb and sumac this was obviously a winner. I’ve made maybe ten of the cakes already? It’s one of the best written and most used cookbooks on my shelf. Very much encourage you to buy it yourself. 

4. Cherry rhubarb bars
I could have eaten this entire pan in like one sitting.


5.  Rhubarb cordial
Oh hell yes this is worth the month long wait. I have a second one in the fridge right now, a version with peach. Can’t wait.

6. Strawberry rhubarb sorbet
Does what it says on the tin! I don’t actually love the strawberry rhubarb combination, I think the strawberries overpower the rhubarb in most things. As a sorbet you get a nice balance.

7. Chicken tagine with rhubarb
Another savory use of rhubarb. Excellent. I did leave the olives out though.

8. Rhubarb and basil panna cotta
I intended to make this vegan, actually - I used coconut heavy cream - but I forgot that gelatin is made out of, like, horse. Alas. Also this recipe calls for pistachios, I don’t remember why I used basil instead. We always have pistachios around. Taylor eats them like I eat, well, rhubarb.

9. Strawberry rhubarb creme brulee 
Allowed strawberries to slip into this one because I roasted them with the rhubarb which tends to improve things somewhat. Don’t assume that as we drop out of the top ten these are getting worse, numbers 4 through 13 may as well be considered tied. 

10.  Pistachio rhubarb bars
One of the first things I made this season, I will probably make them again with tomorrow’s farewell batch (sad face). 

11. Peach rhubarb galette with basil
I think slim overlap in rhubarb and peach seasons around here means they don’t get paired that often. Shame, they work really well together. Why basil? It’s the plant I have on my windowsill (it did fit, flavorwise, I swear).

12.  Rhubarb rosewater tart
This was really lovely and delicate! Just the right amount of rosewater.

13. Rhubarb gateau basque
The creme patissere here is just regular creme pat with an unholy amount of rhubarb compote and syrup mixed in. I brought slices of the gateau to a couple pals at an outdoor hang on the Lyman’s patio where we all agreed that the best foods come in triangle format. 



13. Rhubarbeque sauce
You know, this was fine? Just not strongly rhubarby. I’m also a filthy northerner with low standards for barbeque sauce. Consider this the dividing line between the good and bad.

14.  Rhubarb ricotta ice cream
The memorable part of this was really the ginger roasted rhubarb garnish (which is just rhubarb, sliced, rubbed with grated ginger, and roasted). The ice cream was leftover cannoli filling, the ingredients were similar enough to ice cream with a ricotta base to churn up with minimal alteration. “But Vicky” you are thinking, “I haven’t seen cannoli on this list.” Ah. Well. There is a reason for that. 

15. Rhubarb cannoli
This isn’t rhubarb’s fault. Turns out it’s really hard to make an acceptable cannoli shell? Anyway I brought the cannoli filling and a bunch of cannoli shell pieces to a friend’s outdoor hang and everyone was really nice about it but I still feel bad. It was just bland. Rhubarb is many things, but it isn’t bland.
